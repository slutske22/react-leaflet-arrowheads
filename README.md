# react-leaflet-arrowheads
 React-Leaflet-Arrowheads is a [react-leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) wrapper for leaflet-arrowheads.  [Leaflet-Arrowheads](https://github.com/slutske22/leaflet-arrowheads) is a small plugin for leaflet to quickly draw arrowheads on polylines for vector visualization.

## Demo

You can see an instance of react-leaflet-arrowheads in my [react-leaflet-custom-components](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/slutske22/react-leaflet-custom-components) sandbox (among other custom components for react-leaflet).

## Installation

You can use npm to install react-leaflet-arrowheads:

````
npm install react-leaflet-arrowheads --save
````

## Usage


Instead of importing `{ Polyline }` from `react-leaflet`, you'll import a modified `Polyline` from `react-leaflet-arrowheads`

````javascript
import { Polyline } from 'react-leaflet-arrowheads'
````

Within your `<Map />` component, you can now use this new `Polyline` component.  Using the `arrowheads` prop on this new `Polyline` component will apply arrowheads.

````javascript
<Map>

  <TileLayer ... />

  <Polyline positions={ [coords array] } arrowheads />

</Map>
````

And that's it!

## Options

Declaring a polyline with the `arrowheads` prop with no options object will give the default options:

````javascript
<Polyline positions={ [coords array] } arrowheads />
````

The arrowheads prop can also take a configuration object as its value:

````javascript
<Polyline positions={ [coords array] } arrowheads={ {size: '300m', frequency: '1000m'} } />
````

The options that are available are te same options inherited from leaflet-arrowheads.  [Click here](https://github.com/slutske22/leaflet-arrowheads#options) for a list of options and examples.
